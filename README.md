# Complex Contagion



## About

Created by Lukas RÃ¶hrich, MA Student Physics @ Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Reasearch
    Project start: November 2023

## General Approach

Python library for complex contagion for an adaptive network with heterogeneous agents, each with a individual
dose memory. Model is leaned on a general Dodds-Watts-Model and a general Holme-Newman-Model (see literature).

## Thesis Results

Most of the plots shown in the final version of the thesis are generated with the Jupyter Notebook `ThesisPlots.ipynb`
which can be found in the `reults` directory of this repository.
